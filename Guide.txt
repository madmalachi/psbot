Counter:
can switch into any of the opponent's moves with no drawbacks and kill, set up on, or force out the opponent

Check:
if given a free switch into the opponent, can kill, set up on, or force them out

Choosing a lead:
Prioritize Stealth Rock/(possibly weather)
Player's perspective:
Look at each of the opponents pokemon
compare counters:
- look at common sets for each of the opponents pokemon
- compute the average matchup of each mon against each of your mons (more on this later)
- based on all the matchups, along with stealth rock factored in, calculate the value of each lead
Opponents perspective:
(based on your team, use the above methods to predict the lead the opponent will most likely choose)


Choosing Moves:
If stealth rock is not up, prioritize stealth rock
If stealth rock is up on your side, prioritize defog/rapid spin
